# Privacy Policy for Pickleball Finder

_Last updated: 2025-09-19_

Pickleball Finder ("the App") helps users locate pickleball courts and related information. This policy describes how the App handles data.

## 1. Data We Collect
- **No account required.** We do not create or maintain user accounts.
- **Location input:** When you search for courts, the text you type (e.g., city or address) is used to perform a geocoding lookup. This text is sent to the OpenStreetMap Nominatim / geocoding service (or similar public API) solely to resolve a location.
- **Court data:** Court/location results are retrieved from public OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sources.
- **No persistent personal data:** We do not store personal information, emails, names, or identifiers on our servers (the App currently has no custom backend).

## 2. Local Data Storage
- The App may cache non-personal UI preferences (e.g., theme) locally on your device using standard application storage (local files or browser-like storage APIs). This stays on your machine and is not transmitted to us.

## 3. Network Requests
- Geocoding and court data calls are made to third-party services (e.g., OpenStreetMap / Nominatim endpoints). Those services may log request metadata (IP address, user agent) under their own policies.
- We do not proxy or intercept these requests with our own servers.

## 4. Analytics & Tracking
- The App does **not** include third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking beacons.

## 5. Permissions
- The App does not request or require system location permission; you manually enter a location query. (If future versions add automatic geolocation, this policy will be updated.)

## 6. Children’s Privacy
- The App is general audience software and does not target children specifically. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 7. Data Sharing
- We do not sell or share personal data.
- Public map providers used by the App operate under their own licenses and terms.

## 8. Security
- Since we do not collect or store personal data, risk is minimized. Standard platform protections (operating system sandboxing, Electron security best practices) apply.

## 9. International Users
- Your network requests to map/geocoding services may be processed in other countries depending on service infrastructure.

## 10. Changes to This Policy
- Material changes will update the “Last updated” date and be distributed in release notes.
