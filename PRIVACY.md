# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-09-18

Pickleball Finder (the "App") helps users discover pickleball courts (and future player / event features). This policy explains what data is collected and how it is used.

## Data We Collect
- User search queries (e.g., city names, zip codes) are sent directly to OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoding and Overpass API endpoints in order to resolve locations and retrieve nearby court data.
- We do not store, persist, sell, rent, or profile user data. No personal identifiers (name, email, location history) are collected.
- No analytics or tracking SDKs are embedded.

## Third-Party Services
The App uses the following external services strictly for functional purposes:
- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim** (geocoding) – https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org
- **Overpass API** (OpenStreetMap data queries) – https://overpass-api.de

Requests include only what is necessary to perform the lookup (search string or coordinates). Responses are used in-memory to render court information.

## Cookies / Local Storage
- Local storage is used only to persist UI preferences (e.g., theme: dark/light).
- No tracking cookies are set.

## Offline & Caching
- In-memory caches are used (during the current session) to reduce duplicate network calls. They are not persisted to disk.

## Security
- All network traffic uses HTTPS.
- The application enforces a restrictive Content Security Policy to prevent remote code injection.

## Children
The App is general audience software and does not target children specifically. No personal data is collected from any user.

## Your Choices
- You may stop using the App at any time; no residual personal data remains because none is stored.
- Uninstalling the App removes local storage theme preference.
